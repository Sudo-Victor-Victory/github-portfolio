## <span class="jonquil-yellow-text"> Lessons learned throughout development </span>
This has been roughly 3 months in the making.
It was an insane amount of fun. This project gave me a better understanding of 
- Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)
    - GATT architecture and characteristic design
    - Advertising and connection workflow
    - Character descriptions for notifications
- Electrocardiograms (ECGs)
    - Purpose and signal interpretation fundamentals
    - Electrical conduction pathway of the heart
    - Segments of an ECG waveform
    - Digital signal processing (DSP) techniques such as
        - FIR
        - Kalman
- FreeRTOS
    - Task scheduling and priority management
    - Multi-processor configuration on a dual-core ESP32
    - `delay()` vs `vTaskDelay()` and timing accuracy
    - Preemption behavior and deterministic task execution
- Cloud Databases (Supabase)
    - Designing relational schemas for sensor data 
    - Implementing Row-Level Security (RLS) for user isolation
    - Using the Supabase REST API for CRUD operations
- Flutter
    - Built a complete mobile application from start to finish
    - Utilized `Syncfusion`â€™s charting library for real-time ECG visualization
    - Produced motion effects to enhance user experience

All of those topics are mentioned in my previous blog posts. Please check them out for more information :sparkling_heart:
Here are the repos to both parts of this project.

## What's next
I will most likely keep working on these repositories since there are little enhancements I can perform. No matter what state something is in -  <span class="ecg-gold-highlight"> It can always improve </span>. Thank you for joining me on this journey.
