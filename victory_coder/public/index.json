Having never used Bootstrap, or Hugo, it was \u003cstrong\u003eexciting\u003c/strong\u003e to get all of this working. There were some parts that were frustrating, some parts fascinating, and the end result is amazing.

The TOML config file in your Root Directory is the main entry point of the site. It defines what themes are used if any, what sections are present, and more. If your page doesn\u0026rsquo;t render - check here first.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI hope this was educational. This is the beginning of my website. I will update it more with things I am working on - like my Arduino projects, game development, Azure Certificate progress, and job hunting news. I hope to keep in touch.\u003c/p\u003e\n","description":null,"image":null,"permalink":"https://victory_coder.github.io/blogs/my_first_post/","title":"My First Post"},{"content":"","description":"My gallery ðŸŒŽ","image":null,"permalink":"https://victory_coder.github.io/gallery/","title":"Image Gallery"}]
